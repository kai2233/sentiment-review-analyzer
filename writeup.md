[Answer here]
The most common sentiment that been observed is negative. This can be shown by the bar graph, which negative has the greatest freuncy above other sentiments.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[Answer here]
I believe these labels are relatively reliable. However llm may not be able to accurately identify sentiment of user's review, which in this case at least not for gpt-4o-mini. Consider that when there are large amount of input then some of the reivew will be miss interpreted and the size of result given back from llm is larger than the input size. Risks that this can brings to analysis are result not been normally distrubted and unreliable.
