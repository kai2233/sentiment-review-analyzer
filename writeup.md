## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[Answer here]
The most common sentiment observed is negative. This is shown by the created bar graph, where the negative sentiment has the highest frequency above the others.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[Answer here]
I believe these labels are relatively reliable. However, the LLM may not be accurately identify the sentiment of each user review, at least not in the case of GPT-4o-mini. When there is a large amount of input, some reviews may be misinterpreted, and frequently the output size from the LLM is different from the input size. This introduces risks to the analysis, such as results not being normally distributed and becoming unreliable.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[Answer here]
The most common sentiment is negative. I would suggest the producer randomly select a few negative reviews and use them to improve the product accordingly. I believe there is still an opportunity for this business. According to the created bar graph, although around 26 reviews are negative, there are still 15 positive reviews and 5 neutral reviews. Moreover, negative reviews also represent feedback, which provides a opportunity for improvement.
